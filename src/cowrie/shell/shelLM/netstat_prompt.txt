        NOTES
            This program is mostly obsolete.  Replacement for netstat is ss.  Replacement for netstat -r is ip route.  Replacement for netstat -i is ip -s link.  Replacement for netstat -g is ip maddr.

        DESCRIPTION
            Netstat prints information about the Linux networking subsystem.  The type of information printed is controlled by the first argument, as follows:

        (none)
            By default, netstat displays a list of open sockets.  If you don't specify any address families, then the active sockets of all configured address families will be printed.

        --route, -r
            Display the kernel routing tables. See the description in route(8) for details.  netstat -r and route -e produce the same output.

        --groups, -g
            Display multicast group membership information for IPv4 and IPv6.

        --interfaces, -i
            Display a table of all network interfaces.

        --masquerade, -M
            Display a list of masqueraded connections.

        --statistics, -s
            Display summary statistics for each protocol.

               Tell the user what is going on by being verbose. Especially print some useful information about unconfigured address families.

        --wide, -W
            Do not truncate IP addresses by using output as wide as needed. This is optional for now to not break existing scripts.

        --numeric, -n
            Show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host, port or user names.

        --numeric-hosts
            shows numerical host addresses but does not affect the resolution of port or user names.

        --numeric-ports
            shows numerical port numbers but does not affect the resolution of host or user names.

        --numeric-users
            shows numerical user IDs but does not affect the resolution of host or port names.

        --protocol=family, -A
            Specifies  the  address  families  (perhaps  better described as low level protocols) for which connections are to be shown.  family is a comma (',') separated list of address family keywords like
            inet, inet6, unix, ipx, ax25, netrom, econet, ddp, and bluetooth.  This has the same effect as using the --inet|-4, --inet6|-6, --unix|-x, --ipx, --ax25, --netrom, --ddp, and --bluetooth options.

            The address family inet (Iv4) includes raw, udp, udplite and tcp protocol sockets.

            The address family bluetooth (Iv4) includes l2cap and rfcomm protocol sockets.

        -c, --continuous
            This will cause netstat to print the selected information every second continuously.

        -e, --extend
            Display additional information.  Use this option twice for maximum detail.

        -o, --timers
            Include information related to networking timers.

        -p, --program
            Show the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.

        -l, --listening
            Show only listening sockets.  (These are omitted by default.)

        -a, --all
            Show both listening and non-listening sockets.  With the --interfaces option, show interfaces that are not up

        -F
            Print routing information from the FIB.  (This is the default.)

        -C
            Print routing information from the route cache.
        
        PID/Program name
            Slash-separated  pair  of  the  process id (PID) and process name of the process that owns the socket.  --program causes this column to be included.  You will also need superuser privileges to see
            this information on sockets you don't own.  This identification information is not yet available for IPX sockets.

        Timer
            (this needs to be written)

        Active UNIX domain Sockets
        Proto
            The protocol (usually unix) used by the socket.

        RefCnt
            The reference count (i.e. attached processes via this socket).

        Flags
            The flags displayed is SO_ACCEPTON (displayed as ACC), SO_WAITDATA (W) or SO_NOSPACE (N).  SO_ACCECPTON is used on unconnected sockets if their corresponding processes are waiting  for  a  connect
            request. The other flags are not of normal interest.

        Type
            There are several types of socket access:

            SOCK_DGRAM
                    The socket is used in Datagram (connectionless) mode.

            SOCK_STREAM
                    This is a stream (connection) socket.

            SOCK_RAW
                    The socket is used as a raw socket.

            SOCK_RDM
                    This one serves reliably-delivered messages.

            SOCK_SEQPACKET
                    This is a sequential packet socket.

            SOCK_PACKET
                    Raw interface access socket.

            UNKNOWN
                    Who ever knows what the future will bring us - just fill in here :-)
        State
            This field will contain one of the following Keywords:

            FREE   The socket is not allocated

            LISTENING
                The socket is listening for a connection request.  Such sockets are only included in the output if you specify the --listening (-l) or --all (-a) option.

            CONNECTING
                The socket is about to establish a connection.

            CONNECTED
                The socket is connected.

            DISCONNECTING
                The socket is disconnecting.

            (empty)
                The socket is not connected to another one.

            UNKNOWN
                This state should never happen.
                
        PID/Program name
            Process ID (PID) and process name of the process that has the socket open.  More info available in Active Internet connections section written above.

        Path
            This is the path name as which the corresponding processes attached to the socket.

        Active IPX sockets
            (this needs to be done by somebody who knows it)

        Active NET/ROM sockets
            (this needs to be done by somebody who knows it)

        Active AX.25 sockets
            (this needs to be done by somebody who knows it)
